# Kubernetes Node Selectors

## What Are Node Selectors?

- **Definition**: Node selectors are the simplest way to constrain Pods to run on specific nodes.
    
- **Mechanism**: The scheduler matches labels on nodes with selectors in the Pod spec.
    
- **Use case**: Direct workloads to nodes that have specific characteristics (e.g., hardware, environment, zone).

## Example Cluster Setup

Imagine a cluster with 3 nodes:

- **node1** → larger node (more CPU/RAM).
    
- **node2** and **node3** → smaller nodes with limited resources.
    

You want **data processing Pods** to always run on `node1` because only it has enough resources.

### Step 1: Label the Node

```yaml
kubectl label nodes node1 size=large
kubectl label nodes node2 size=small
kubectl label nodes node3 size=small
```

**Verify labels**:
```yaml
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
```

### Step 2: Pod Manifest with Node Selector

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dataprocessor
spec:
  containers:
  - name: datacontainer
    image: busybox
    command: ["sleep", "3600"]
  nodeSelector:
    size: large
```

**Apply it:**

```yaml
kubectl apply -f dataprocessor.yaml
```

**Verify scheduling:

```yaml
kubectl get pod -o wide
```

Output shows `dataprocessor` is scheduled on `node1`.

## How Does It Work?

- Pod spec includes a `nodeSelector` with key/value.
    
- Scheduler checks all nodes → only those with `size=large` qualify.
    
- Pod is bound to that node.

##  Limitations of Node Selector

- **Only exact matches** allowed.
    
    - Example: `size=large` → no OR/NOT logic.
        
- **Not flexible** for complex requirements:
    
    - Can’t say: “Run on `large OR medium` nodes.”
        
    - Can’t say: “Avoid `small` nodes.”
        
- For advanced scenarios, use **Node Affinity**.

## Real-World Use Cases

1. **Hardware-based scheduling**
    
    - GPU nodes: `kubectl label node node-gpu accelerator=nvidia`
        
    - Pod → `nodeSelector: { accelerator: nvidia }`
        
2. **Environment separation**
    
    - Nodes labeled as `env=dev`, `env=prod`.
        
    - Pods scheduled only to appropriate environment nodes.
        
3. **Zone or Region selection**
    
    - Nodes labeled `zone=us-east1`, `zone=us-west1`.
        
    - Pods forced to specific zone for latency reduction.

## Summary

- Node selectors = **simple, exact match** scheduling mechanism.
    
- Works with **labels** you define on nodes.
    
- Good for **basic use cases** (dedicated hardware, environments).
    
- For **complex logic** → move to **Node Affinity/Anti-Affinity**.
